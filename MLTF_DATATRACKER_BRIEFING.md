## Vision & Mission

### Vision
To build the governance layer for the next internet – a transparent, participatory, and regenerative framework that ensures the interface layer (where meaning, identity, and trust are formed) serves humanity's best interests.

### Mission
Create a platform where anyone can contribute to developing the foundational practices, terminology, and standards that will govern the meta-layer, ensuring that the next level of the internet is built with open participation, rough consensus, and permanent transparency.

### Core Principles
- **Transparency:** All drafts, comments, and decisions are publicly visible
- **Open Participation:** Anyone can create an account and contribute
- **Rough Consensus:** Decisions are made through community discussion, not formal voting
- **Permanent Archiving:** All contributions are permanently recorded
- **Quality Over Quantity:** Thoughtful, substantive engagement is valued

## Competitive Positioning

### What Makes MLTF Different

**1. Starting with Governance**
- Most platforms apply governance to existing systems
- We're building governance from the ground up
- Starting with governance itself (ML-Draft-001)

**2. Interface Layer Focus**
- Not just technical protocols
- Focus on meaning, identity, trust
- Human–agent interaction at the center

**3. Proven Principles, New Application**
- Rough consensus (proven in IETF)
- Transparency (permanent archiving)
- Open participation (anyone can contribute)
- Applied to interface-level governance

**4. People-Centered**
- Not just technology for technology's sake
- Governance that serves humanity
- Regenerative systems thinking

### Competitive Landscape

**Similar Platforms:**
- IETF Datatracker (technical protocols)
- GitHub (code collaboration)
- Wikipedia (knowledge governance)
- W3C (web standards)

**Differentiation:**
- **IETF:** Technical protocols vs. governance frameworks
- **GitHub:** Code vs. governance documents
- **Wikipedia:** Knowledge vs. foundational practices
- **W3C:** Web standards vs. interface-layer governance

**Unique Position:**
Only platform building governance for the interface layer from the ground up, starting with governance itself.
