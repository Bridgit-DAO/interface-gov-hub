# Development Environment Fix - Status

## Code Change Verified ✓

The code change is confirmed in the file:
- **File**: `ietf_data_viewer_simple.py`
- **Line**: 3576
- **Change**: "Welcome to the Meta-Layer Governance Hub"

## Commands Executed

I have executed the following commands to fix the development environment:

1. ✓ Stopped datatracker-dev.service
2. ✓ Cleared Python cache
3. ✓ Verified code change in file
4. ✓ Started datatracker-dev.service
5. ✓ Verified service is running

## Next Steps

The service should now be running with the updated code. Please:

1. **Visit**: https://dev.hub.themetalayer.org
2. **Hard refresh**: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
3. **Verify**: You should see "Welcome to the Meta-Layer Governance Hub"

## If Still Not Working

If the change still doesn't appear:

1. Check service status:
   ```bash
   systemctl --user status datatracker-dev.service
   ```

2. Check if port is listening:
   ```bash
   netstat -tlnp | grep 8001
   ```

3. Test directly:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8001/ | grep "Welcome"
   ```

4. Check logs:
   ```bash
   journalctl --user -u datatracker-dev.service -n 50
   ```

## Manual Restart (If Needed)

If you need to manually restart:
```bash
systemctl --user restart datatracker-dev.service
sleep 5
curl http://localhost:8001/ | grep "Welcome"
```

The code change is definitely in the file and the service restart commands have been executed.
